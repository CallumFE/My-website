    <div><h2 class="subt">Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
        <p class="above">IT in business is imperitive nowadays in business for many reasons such as Communication is essential for linking business to
            customers not just in local areas but throughout the world and with the helo of the internet and social media we are more
            connected than ever. Furthermore storing data, the compact hard drives as well as steadfast memory allows for more efficent
            and less space comsuming storage allowing buinesses to have clearer accesss to data they need as well as requiring less space
            and time to access the data. As well as security with the introduction of cameras identifying and preventing criminal 
            activity is more effective than ever and things like motion sensors and password locked doors provide securer locations which
            would be harder for crimals to gain access to. Finally Analysis, computers make analysing markets a must in todays
            competitive business environment as they can swifty access the data needed as well as use sofisticated alogorythems to 
            analyse the data and highlight key area where a business can gain an edge over the competition.</p>

    <div><h2 class="subt">Describing the method, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h2>
    <p class="above">To make digital projects work you need a variety of different skills and resources for whatever task that needs to be completed.
        For example an ample knowledge of computer programs is ideal but not necissary, however, what is necissary is the drive to 
        independantly seek out these programs and having the knowledge of what you want the program to achieve for you, like when
        making our text based games VSCode is vital to making the game as well as the knowledge of the prograsmming language Python to
        be able to write code that the computer can recognise and translate into a working game. Futhermore Trello was a great help
        in organising the team so everyone could tell what eachother was doing and monitor progress being made as well as slack and google hangouts for communication.</p>

    <div><h2 class="subt">Plan and carry out tasks using IT</h2>
        <p class="above">When using IT is is important to be very attentive to detail as the smallest mistakes can lead to everything not working.
            Therefore we need to carefullly plan out what we are doing using something like Trello and constantly test as we go to make
            sure we do not miss anything as well as knowing where the problem originated. Futhermore using a program like Trello can help
            to maximise efficentcy and reduce planning time to help you finish your projects in a timely manner. Also Trello is great
            for group projects as you can make many different lists and assign labels to the cards within the list for example giving 
            each member a specific colour and assigning that colour to the work they are currently doing which would help to keep the 
            whole team informed of what eachother is currently doing.</p>

    <div><h2 class="subt">Describe the risks of that might impact digital projects</h2>
    <p class="above">There are many risks when using technology that you must be aware of such as hardware failures when using hardware weather it
        is an external spilled drink or an internal virus all of the saved data on the hardware can be corrupted and lost which can
        lead to a devestating impact on the running of a business which is why back ups always need to be saved on something sucure
        like the cloud as well as physical back ups for exceptional circumstances. Furthermore hardware exposures if your hardware
        is infiltrated by a virus that steals your data you can risk exposing sensitive information to whomever stole it from you
        leading to a loss of reputation for your business which could make current customers and potential customers lose faith in 
        you. As well as simple internet failures for example, you are an independant worker who relies on the internet to complete
        your work even losing your internet for a week through a blackout or an issue with the provider can be disatorous for your
        business and many businesses are just a few weeks lost revenue from closure.</p>

    <div><h2 class="subt">Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h2>
    <p class="below">I would ask an expert as I would not want to be stuck with the wrong product. However, if the product is for a minor thing I
        would happily do my own independant research. For example if I needed a server to connect 20 different computers in an
        office, it would be very inefficent to have the server crash often or malfuction often and would stop all 20 computers and
        by extention employees from being able to work. But if i simply needed a printer that could pront in colour I would do my
        own independant research online to see what printer I could get that would be affordable, have a long life span and print in
        colour.</p>
    <a href="http://itexperts.sy/" target="_blank">For example</a></div>
    <div><h2 class="subt">Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcome</h2>
        <p class="below">To achieve my outcome I have used HTML to write and import pictures into VScode and allow it to be converted into a webpage
            with displayable pictures and text. After using HTML to add the contents to the webpage I used CSS to format the text and
            images of the webpage and add a background image to each page. Furthermore I used a Trello board to organise what I had to do
            and what I was currently doing and already done as to help me keep track of where I was up to and what was still to be done.Lastly I used Github to publish my website as it is a way to publish none trademark websites that are designed to not make
            any money.</p>

    <div><h2 class="subt">Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital tech</h2>
    <p class="below">Due to the risks of digital technology and it being vulnerable to being stolen and the sensitive information that will be
        stored there are certain guidelines that you must follow such as GDPR. GDPR has many rules to follow which are for the safety
        of the customer as well as lessening the risks of the business. For example GDPR states that consent and right to be informed
        of information that is stored is essential because it gives the business legal protection and right for sensitive information
        to be stored on the database as well as the customer the right to refuse the business the right to store that data and a 
        clear way for the customer to take legal action against any business that does store this data without a signature or stores
        any data that was not specified to the customer without a signature or proof, such as a recored phone call proving that the
        customers identity was confirmed, that the customer was informed that the information would be stored. Furthermore encryption
        of personal data can stop businesses being fined for the breach of that data as well as secure the personal data of the
        customer in the best way possible. Finally the right to be forgotten is also essential for the customer to be able to 
        redact the consent given to store the data orginally given or when the customers data is no longer needed it is due to be
        deleted, not only does this give the customer peace of mind and the power to change their mind it also gives the business
        a clear rule to follow and strictly puts the power in the customers hands giving them less to worry about in terms of 
        customer service as the rule is clear and failure to follow will result in fines.</p>
