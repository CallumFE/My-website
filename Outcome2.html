    <div><h2 class="subt">Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed when making your own website</h2>
        <p class="above">When making the website VScode was great for keeping the whole project all in one place as well as storing images which is
            perfect for constructing the contents of the website and designing it. Also the process of making the website was make clear
            and simple through the use of trello which allowed me to focus on the what I was doing. Furthermore there was an issue I had
            when trying to import a background image through the folder therefore I had to use an image link from online which is one
            of the many reasons VScode is useful as it has the ability to complete tasks with more than one method.</p></div>
    </div>
    <div><h2 class="subt">Describe weather the the IT tools selected were appropriate</h2>
    <p class="above">The IT tools seleted were very fit for purpose such as the flexibility of VScode which allows you to use HTML and CSS all in
        one place allowing you to organise the project much easier and gives you the appropriate information when makiing a mistake
        to go and correct it. Also because I was doing this course online instead of through a classroom tools like VScode are a
        great help as they are free tools which can simply be downloaded online which in my opinon overshadows any drawbacks which
        may come with it such as the lack of options for sytling that comes with it although these can also be freely taken from
        online places like google. I have have to use notepad to do the written work though which is free and comes with the computer
        so there was no fuss in attaining it, it lacks spellcheck, wordcount adn many more useful tools something like Microsoft Word
        would have come with.</p></div>
    <div><h2 class="subt">Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final product</h2>
    <p class="below">My product goes with a minimalist design which serves as both a strength and weakness as it makes the pages clear and easy
        to read and well formatted, however, it highlights my weakness for creativity when it comes to designing. Furthermore I have 
        had some simple suggestions to make it look better as well as the contents of the pages such as images and adding additional
        writing where needed. If I had more time or was working in a team I would work to make the website look more professional as
        well as make it more personalised.</p></div>
    <div><h2 class="subt">Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>
    <p class="below">I am not the most creative person therefore coming uo with a web design is hard for me. So if I had more time i would have
        done more to make it pleasing to the eyes as well as look for online tutorials as to better further my knowledge on how to
        make more creative designs. Therefore I could make it look more professional and draw attention better. Also there are little
        nitpicks I have that I deemed unimportant so I did not focus on them such as the fonts and colours being used which I could
        taken some fonts from online or used the colour wheel to make the perfect colour I wanted to use for example I wanted to 
        make all the text green but in the standard colours could not find a green that worked with the sky background which I could
        have also solved by getting a background with the nights sky instead but I had trouble finding one.</p></div>
    <div><h2 class="subt">Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>
    <p class="below">When looking at the outcomes from the changes I was making to the design in CSS i made sure to do it in a step by step
        process so that I could identify the exact bit of code the change was relating to as well as chop and change that code to 
        make it more fit for purpose as to how I wanted it look although this process is very thorough it was time consuming. 
        Furthermore I made sure to make the changes with the class method as this allowed me to experiment with only a small bit
        at a time without distrupting the rest of the page before I made the other parts into the classes I needed them to be.</p></div>
