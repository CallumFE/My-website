<h2 class="subt">About me</h2>
<p class="above">I am a highly intelligent and determined mature young man. Hard work and reliability are only some of my wide range of key
    employability skills which also included being highly punctual and the useful ability to meet deadlines consistently.
    Furthermore a conscientious motivated personality combined with my ability to learn quickly help me to be flexible and carry
    out my duties to a high standard. My aim is to become the best in my chosen career and this stimulates me to always be the 
    best I can be. I believe coding is a very useful skill in the business world therefore I have chosen to join Code Nations
    coding course to further my employability skills.</p>
