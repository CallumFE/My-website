    <div><h2 class="subt">Describe the content and layout of each page</h2>
        <p class="above">I have a total of five pages each consisting of a background image, links inbetween the pages and formatted text in boxes.
            Page one has some information about me as well as some pictures I have drawn in my spare time. Page two has the answers to
            the questions from unit one outcome one with relevant links and another picture that was actually for mothers day that i
            decided to start adding too although I stopped because it wasn't coming out how I wanted it to look. Page three and four
            have the answers for outcome two and three and finally page five has the answers for unit two outcome one.</p></div>

    <div><h2 class="subt">Describe copyright and other restraits affecting websites</h2>
    <p class="above">Copyright affects every website and if something like an image contains a watermark or a faded background signature or even
        just a link for the full image the image is most likly someone elses property therefore to use that image in a legitimate
        website you need to either get legal permission or pay for the content. Licensing your property (not just images but videos,
        audio and much more can be copyrighted) is a must in todays environment becuase of the way things can be perfectly copied on
        the digital landscape which is why it is more important than every to work with artists and designers to licesence their
        content and avoid being sued by what could be a silly mistake.</p></div>
    <div><h2 class="subt">Describe access issues that need to be taken into account</h2>
    <p class="below">There are many disabilities that could affect someone trying to access your websites such as blindness, dyslexia or epilepsy.
        In order to overcome some of these disabilities computers come with built in measures. For example there are marks on the F
        and J keys on an QWERT keyboard so that someone who is blind can find there way around it as well as web browsers coming with
        a text to speech option where by the brower will speak text which is highlighted or an entire page which is why it is important
        to check spelling when making the text for your website. Furthermore for someone who is dyslexic or has eye strain they can
        install apps to the computer that allows them to change the colours displayed on screen to make it easier to read or to reduce
        the amount of strain on the eyes which can be implemented on the website itself as well. Also for those with epilepsy websites
        can come with either a warning to stop the user from advancing to the page or simply not using flashing images to protect 
        those potential users.</p></div>
    <div><h2 class="subt">Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h2>
    <p class="below">When creating your web page it is important to use HTML for the contents of the page as well as CSS or whatever fits your
        website the best for design purposes as these help with formatting and importing the contents to the webpage. Furthermore
        for things like pictures .jpg or .png are some of the types of pictures you will come across and it is important to be able
        to find which file type the picture is saved as or you will nnot be able to import in into the HTML page. Also for things
        like audio clips you can use .mp3 and many others as well as .pdf or .txt for text or word documents there are many different
        file types that will come with all types of files and these need to be understood and managed carefully when importing them
        into your HTML documents or else they will not work.</p></div>
