    <div><h2 class="subt">Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and effiency</h2>
        <p class="above">In terms of drawbacks it is very cear that these projects need to be for individuals as the process of building the code is
            unique to every person therefore it would be very inconvenient and time consuming to have others review your code constantly
            nevermind try to make their own changes to the code. In terms of benifits as long as you understand what you want to do and 
            have a good knowledge of CSS and HTML it is very easy to format the page as you want and insert the information you want to
            be displayed.</p></div>
    </div>
    <div><h2 class="subt">Describe ways to improve productivity and effiency</h2>
    <p class="above">I believe for me it would be very benifital to be in a classroom as my internet connection has been on and off during this
        part of the course and there are also less distractions in the classroom as compared to at home where I have to managed the
        dog, make sure the fence that was rebuilt went smoothly with the builders and general day to day dealing with peoplpe who
        come to the door. There are also things like keyboard shortcuts which would come with more experiance with using VScode.</p></div>
    <div><h2 class="subt">Develop ways to improve productivity using IT in digital projects</h2>
    <p class="below">There are always ways to improve productivity such as taking coding courses to further your knowledge and gain more
        experiance in using code which would help you to be able to write the code without as much effort or thought as constantly
        looking back and checkinig for errors. Furthermore you can use things such as keyboard shortcuts to improve day to day speed
        of activities as well as saving the useful websites and documents you are provided with if you ever get stuck and need to
        refresh you memory. As well as setting goals and tasks to help progression to be fastracked and not get off target.</p></div>
    <div><h2 class="subt">Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>
    <p class="below">When making the website I made sure to worki n a step by step process so that when I made changes I knew exactly what bit of
        code was making the change as well as seeing the impact it had on the webpage. This method allowed me to be able to clearly
        see what bits of code was causing any prolems and gave me ample time to research solutions before implementing them.
        Futhermore I made good use of the class method so that when I got something looking how I wanted it to I was able to make
        the other areas the same class instead of rewriting all the code which is fantastic for being sure of the outcome that would
        be produced.</p></div>
